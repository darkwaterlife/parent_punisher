Privacy Policy for Punishment Generator
Effective Date: June 25, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how [Your Name or Company Name Here] ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Punishment Generator application (the "App").

Information We Do Not Collect
We want to be crystal clear: we do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information from you. This includes, but is not limited to:

Your name

Your email address

Your physical address

Your phone number

Your device's unique identifiers

Your location information

Our App is designed to be completely anonymous.

Information We Store Locally on Your Device
To improve your experience and ensure the punishments remain varied, the App uses a standard browser feature called localStorage.

What is stored: When a punishment is generated, a unique, non-personal identifier for that punishment (e.g., "c1" or "t2") and a timestamp are saved in your browser's localStorage.

Why it is stored: This data is used for a single purpose: to prevent the same punishment from appearing again for a period of 7 days. This ensures the App remains fun and unpredictable.

Where it is stored: This information is stored only on your own device within your web browser's storage. It is never transmitted to us or any third party. We have no access to this information.

How to Clear This Data
You can clear all data stored by our App at any time by clearing your web browser's cache and site data.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
